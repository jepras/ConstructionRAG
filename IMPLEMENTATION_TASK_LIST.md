## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Docker build failures**: Test Docker builds early and often
- **Railway deployment issues**: Start with simple deployment, add complexity gradually
- **Environment variable management**: Document all variables and test in both environments
- **Database connection issues**: Test connections from both local and production early

### Operational Risks
- **API rate limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **Memory usage**: Monitor memory usage in Docker containers
- **File upload limits**: Test with various file sizes and types
- **Background task failures**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic

### Deployment Risks
- **Environment variable mismatches**: Use consistent naming and test thoroughly
- **Service communication failures**: Test inter-service communication early
- **SSL certificate issues**: Test SSL configuration in staging environment
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor performance metrics continuously
