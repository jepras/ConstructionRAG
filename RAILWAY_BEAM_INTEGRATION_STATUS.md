# Railway/Beam Integration Status Report

## Current Status: Railway/Beam Integration

### ✅ **What's Working**

#### **1. Railway Side (Email Upload Endpoint)**
- ✅ Creates indexing runs in database
- ✅ Stores PDF files in Supabase Storage
- ✅ Creates document records linked to indexing runs
- ✅ Attempts to trigger Beam tasks (but fails)
- ✅ Returns proper response with indexing_run_id

#### **2. Beam Side (Task Execution)**
- ✅ Successfully deployed and accessible
- ✅ Can receive HTTP requests with indexing_run_id and document_ids
- ✅ Connects to Supabase database successfully
- ✅ Can find documents in database
- ✅ Environment variables fixed (OpenRouter and Voyage API keys)
- ✅ Uses existing orchestrator code (no reinvention)

#### **3. Database & Storage**
- ✅ Supabase connection working for both Railway and Beam
- ✅ File storage working correctly
- ✅ Document records created and linked properly

### ❌ **What's Not Working**

#### **1. Railway → Beam Automatic Trigger**
- ❌ Railway endpoint shows "Beam trigger failed"
- ❌ Manual Beam task triggering works, but automatic doesn't
- **Root Cause**: Railway missing Beam environment variables (`BEAM_WEBHOOK_URL`, `BEAM_AUTH_TOKEN`)

#### **2. Database Connection Issue**
- ❌ Beam can find documents but not indexing runs
- ❌ Error: "No indexing run found for ID: [uuid]"
- **Root Cause**: Likely different database connections or timing issue

## 🔧 **Architecture Status**

### **Current Flow (Working)**
```
1. User Upload → Railway API ✅
2. Railway → Supabase Storage (file) ✅  
3. Railway → Create indexing_run ✅
4. Railway → Create document records ✅
5. Railway → Beam Task Queue (FAILS) ❌
6. Manual: Beam → Use existing indexing_run_id ✅
7. Beam → Execute Pipeline (FAILS at database lookup) ❌
```

### **Target Flow (Not Yet Working)**
```
1. User Upload → Railway API ✅
2. Railway → Supabase Storage (file) ✅  
3. Railway → Create indexing_run ✅
4. Railway → Create document records ✅
5. Railway → Beam Task Queue (AUTOMATIC) ❌
6. Beam → Use existing indexing_run_id ✅
7. Beam → Execute Pipeline (SUCCESS) ❌
8. Beam → Update progress in Supabase ❌
9. Beam → Callback to Railway ❌
```

## 📋 **Remaining Tasks**

### **Phase 1: Fix Current Issues (High Priority)**
1. **Add Beam environment variables to Railway**
   - `BEAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://construction-rag-indexing-209899a-v16.app.beam.cloud`
   - `BEAM_AUTH_TOKEN=ov0HB26uYWLIKWPSPVSgP2XY_wmcvHw3UCZSCBhJXIQZT73br_DiCAXP3nyd8yFt8TwMXveBDEMMqJz0755sZA==`

2. **Debug database connection issue**
   - Investigate why Beam can't find indexing runs
   - Check if Railway and Beam are using same database instance
   - Verify database permissions and connection strings

### **Phase 2: Complete Integration (Medium Priority)**
3. **Test automatic Railway → Beam triggering**
4. **Verify complete pipeline execution**
5. **Add callback mechanism (Beam → Railway)**
6. **Test end-to-end flow with real documents**

### **Phase 3: Production Hardening (Low Priority)**
7. **Add error handling and retry logic**
8. **Implement progress tracking**
9. **Add monitoring and alerting**
10. **Clean up unused code and dependencies**

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Add Beam environment variables to Railway dashboard**
2. **Test automatic triggering**
3. **Debug the "No indexing run found" error**
4. **Verify complete pipeline execution**

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

- **Architecture is sound**: Railway creates data, Beam processes it
- **No major code changes needed**: Using existing orchestrator
- **Environment variables are the blocker**: Railway can't trigger Beam
- **Database connection needs investigation**: Beam can read documents but not indexing runs

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **Latest Test (2025-09-03)**
- **Railway Email Upload**: ✅ Success
  - Created indexing run: `fe9bc251-9f51-4a94-bb38-d4541a70a865`
  - Created document: `9a95522d-eeaf-4748-9758-c6b154ae3a53`
  - Response: "Processing started (Beam trigger failed)"

- **Manual Beam Trigger**: ✅ Success
  - Task created: `8dc3d845-1faf-4a6f-b377-c91ec082772f`
  - Found document in database
  - Failed at: "No indexing run found for ID: f7ce405f-fa4b-4e22-84be-49a283252d56"

### **Environment Variables Fixed**
- ✅ OpenRouter API key access fixed in `enrichment.py`
- ✅ Voyage API key access fixed in `embedding.py`
- ❌ Beam environment variables missing in Railway

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Current Implementation**
- **Railway**: FastAPI backend on Railway platform
- **Beam**: GPU-accelerated task queue for ML processing
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for file management
- **Orchestrator**: Existing 5-step indexing pipeline (partition → metadata → enrichment → chunking → embedding)

### **Integration Points**
- **Railway → Beam**: HTTP POST to Beam webhook
- **Beam → Database**: Direct Supabase admin client connection
- **Beam → Storage**: Direct Supabase storage access
- **Progress Tracking**: Database updates via orchestrator

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **Railway**
- ✅ Deployed and accessible
- ✅ Email upload endpoint working
- ❌ Missing Beam environment variables

### **Beam**
- ✅ Deployed and accessible
- ✅ Task queue working
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ❌ Database connection issue with indexing runs

The foundation is solid - we just need to fix the connection issues and environment variables to get the automatic flow working.
