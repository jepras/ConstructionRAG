        ConstructionRAG is an AI-powered system that:
        
        - **Processes construction documents** (PDFs, plans, specifications)
        - **Generates project overviews** automatically
        - **Answers complex questions** about your construction projects
        - **Organizes information** by building systems and project phases
        
        Think of it as a **DeepWiki for Construction Sites** - just like DeepWiki analyzes code repositories, 
        we analyze construction documentation to create comprehensive project knowledge bases.
